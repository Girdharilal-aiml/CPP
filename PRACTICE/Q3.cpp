/*
2. Create a C++ program to handle student marks management. The program should allow users to
input marks for students in four courses: PF, OOP, DLD & ICT. It should then calculate the total
marks, average marks, and determine the grade for each student based on their average.
Use the following grading metrics:
90 or above: Grade A
80-89: Grade B
70-79: Grade C
60-69: Grade D
Below 60: Grade F
