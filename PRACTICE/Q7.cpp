/*
Imagine you are working on a project where the efficient generation of odd numbers is crucial.
Your task is to write a C++ function that prints an odd number after every sequence of 5 even
numbers in the range provided by the user. The catch is that you need to optimize the program for
both correctness and efficiency.
