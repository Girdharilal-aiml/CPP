/*
Imagine you are tasked with creating a program to manage a library's book inventory. Each
book has attributes such as title, author, publication year, and genre. Design a struct that
effectively represents a book as a real-world entity. Then, write a C++ program that utilizes
this struct to demonstrate the creation, modification, and display of book information.
a) Extend the program to manage multiple books in an array.
b) Implement a function to search for a book by title or author.
c) Allow the user to input new books and update existing book information
interactively.
